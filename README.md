This repository contains the implementation of the deepfake detection model using XceptionNet as presented in the paper: **A. V and P. T. Joy, "Deepfake Detection Using XceptionNet," 2023 IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances in Systems Science and Engineering (RASSE), Kerala, India, 2023, pp. 1-5.** [Read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/RASSE60029.2023.10363477)

## Overview

Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This project leverages the XceptionNet architecture to detect such deepfakes with high accuracy.

## Problem Statement

- **Problem Statement ID:** 1683
